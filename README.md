# Firefly-Algorithm

It's a simple implementation of Firefly algorithm which cotains the most used objective functions implemented already.
<br />

Problem:<br />
1 - Sphere;<br />
2 - Rotated Rastrigin;<br />
3 - Rosenbrock.<br />

It's been already developed Sphere, Rotated Rastrigin and Rosenbrock objective functions.
<br />
Into simulations fold contains some examples of CSV files resulted from simulations using all the objective functions.
